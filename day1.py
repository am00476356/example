# IDE  -- Integrated Development env

# Strings // characters
# anything which you can type is a string -- UNICODE // ASCII code
# individual element  ==> character
# collection of characters ==> string
# python doesn't have char, string
# define a string

# duck type --> on the go data type identify
# class which contains everything(functionalities) is called str
# commentss

statement = """Hello
            World"""
print(statement)

"""
1. to define a string i can enclose the statement within '' or "" or """""" or '''str'''
2. usage of any depends on the content
    a. if the string contains single quotes and in in one line --> enclose it with double quotes
    b. if the string contains double quotes and in in one line --> enclose it with single quotes
    c. if it is a multiline string enclose within triple quotes
    d. if the string contains single and double both then enclose with triple quotes
3. Things within the triple quotes are also called as doc/documentation strings.
4. Empty sting  = '', ""
5. Boolean of empty string equates False, and all other strings equate true

alphanum == "abc123"
alpha == "abc"
isnum == "123124"

'Hello Hi how are you?' --> how many h in the sentence

"""

x = ''  # boolean value false
y = 'word'  # boolean value True
z = ' '  # not an empty string


# day1.py --> day1.pyc --> Interpreted
# basically python is first compiled and then interpreted.
